\section{Introdução}
\label{sec:org26fe70a}

Este trabalho consiste na execução do código \texttt{./src/laplace.cpp} e na perfilagem do código.

O código é um algoritmo para resolução da Equação de Laplace utilizando o método das diferenças finitas.

Sobre a perfilagem, é um processo para entender o comportamento e performance de um código. Esse processo permite encontrar pontos onde podemos otimizar o nosso código, esses pontos são chamados de \emph{hot spots}.

\section{Utilizando gprof para perfilar}
\label{sec:orgfffe73f}
Para perfilar o código, podemos executar comando
\begin{verbatim}
$ make profile
\end{verbatim}
ou manualmente
\begin{verbatim}
$ g++ -g -pg [SOURCE_FILE] -o [OUTPUT_FILE]
# Ao executar o código, um arquivo gmon.out será criado
$ [OUTPUT_FILE]
# O perfil então pode ser criado pelo gprof
$ gprof [BIN_FILE] gmon.out > profile.txt
\end{verbatim}

 This table describes the call tree of the program, and was sorted by
 the total amount of time spent in each function and its children.

 Each entry in this table consists of several lines.  The line with the
 index number at the left hand margin lists the current function.
 The lines above it list the functions that called this function,
 and the lines below it list the functions this one called.
 This line lists:
     index	A unique number given to each element of the table.
		Index numbers are sorted numerically.
		The index number is printed next to every function name so
		it is easier to look up where the function is in the table.

     % time	This is the percentage of the `total' time that was spent
		in this function and its children.  Note that due to
		different viewpoints, functions excluded by options, etc,
		these numbers will NOT add up to 100%.

     self	This is the total amount of time spent in this function.

     children	This is the total amount of time propagated into this
		function by its children.

     called	This is the number of times the function was called.
		If the function called itself recursively, the number
		only includes non-recursive calls, and is followed by
		a `+' and the number of recursive calls.

     name	The name of the current function.  The index number is
		printed after it.  If the function is a member of a
		cycle, the cycle number is printed between the
		function's name and the index number.


 For the function's parents, the fields have the following meanings:

     self	This is the amount of time that was propagated directly
		from the function into this parent.

     children	This is the amount of time that was propagated from
		the function's children into this parent.

     called	This is the number of times this parent called the
		function `/' the total number of times the function
		was called.  Recursive calls to the function are not
		included in the number after the `/'.

     name	This is the name of the parent.  The parent's index
		number is printed after it.  If the parent is a
		member of a cycle, the cycle number is printed between
		the name and the index number.

 If the parents of the function cannot be determined, the word
 `<spontaneous>' is printed in the `name' field, and all the other
 fields are blank.

 For the function's children, the fields have the following meanings:

     self	This is the amount of time that was propagated directly
		from the child into the function.

     children	This is the amount of time that was propagated from the
		child's children to the function.

     called	This is the number of times the function called
		this child `/' the total number of times the child
		was called.  Recursive calls by the child are not
		listed in the number after the `/'.

     name	This is the name of the child.  The child's index
		number is printed after it.  If the child is a
		member of a cycle, the cycle number is printed
		between the name and the index number.

 If there are any cycles (circles) in the call graph, there is an
 entry for the cycle-as-a-whole.  This entry shows who called the
 cycle (as parents) and the members of the cycle (as children.)
 The `+' recursive calls entry shows the number of function calls that
 were internal to the cycle, and the calls entry for each member shows,
 for that member, how many times it was called from other members of
 the cycle.

\subsection{Análise}
\label{sec:org5e4f88e}
Segundo o flat profile, o tempo de execução é de 0.29s e conseguimos perceber dois hotspots:
\begin{itemize}
\item função timeStep:

\noindent\rule{\textwidth}{0.5pt}
\begin{verbatim}
Real LaplaceSolver ::timeStep(const Real dt) {
  Real dx2 = g->dx * g->dx;
  Real dy2 = g->dy * g->dy;
  Real tmp;
  Real err = 0.0;
  int nx = g->nx;
  int ny = g->ny;
  Real **u = g->u;
  for (int i = 1; i < nx - 1; ++i) {
    for (int j = 1; j < ny - 1; ++j) {
      tmp = u[i][j];
      u[i][j] = ((u[i - 1][j] + u[i + 1][j]) * dy2 +
		 (u[i][j - 1] + u[i][j + 1]) * dx2) *
		0.5 / (dx2 + dy2);
      err += SQR(u[i][j] - tmp);
    }
  }
  return sqrt(err);
}
\end{verbatim}

\noindent\rule{\textwidth}{0.5pt}
\item função SQR

\noindent\rule{\textwidth}{0.5pt}
\begin{verbatim}
inline Real SQR(const Real &x) { return (x * x); }
\end{verbatim}

\noindent\rule{\textwidth}{0.5pt}
\end{itemize}

Analisando o código em \texttt{src/laplace.cpp}, é possível perceber que há espaço para melhorias de desempenho.


\section{Otimizando o código}
\label{sec:org82b0288}

\subsection{Função timeStep}
\label{sec:orgf5e68a4}
Apesar de ser uma função com poucas chamadas, a função timeStep é responsável por boa parte do tempo de execução. Essa função pode ser otimizada na maneira que executa algumas operações dentro do loop, que são uma constantes dentro dos loops aninhados.

Essa função também é responsável pela chamada da função \texttt{SQR}, que será analisada no próximo item.

\subsection{Função SQR}
\label{sec:org05df842}
A função SQR, por ser uma simples multiplicação, pode facilmente ser removida. Ao invés de realizar as chamadas à função SQR, pode ser feita a multiplicação utilizando o operador \texttt{*}.


Após as alterações, a função \texttt{timeStamp} (que era a única que dependente da função \texttt{SQR}) ficou assim:

\noindent\rule{\textwidth}{0.5pt}
\begin{verbatim}
Real LaplaceSolver ::timeStep(const Real dt) {
  Real dx2 = g->dx * g->dx;
  Real dy2 = g->dy * g->dy;
  Real tmp;
  Real err = 0.0;
  Real sum = dx2 + dy2;
  Real mult = 1 / sum;
  int nx = g->nx;
  int ny = g->ny;
  Real **u = g->u;
  for (int i = 1; i < nx - 1; ++i) {
    for (int j = 1; j < ny - 1; ++j) {
      tmp = u[i][j];
      u[i][j] = ((u[i - 1][j] + u[i + 1][j]) * dy2 +
		 (u[i][j - 1] + u[i][j + 1]) * dx2) *
		mult;
      Real diff = u[i][j] - tmp;
      err += diff * diff;
    }
  }
  return sqrt(err);
}
\end{verbatim}

\noindent\rule{\textwidth}{0.5pt}

O relatório gerado pelo gprof após as otimizações é o que segue:

 This table describes the call tree of the program, and was sorted by
 the total amount of time spent in each function and its children.

 Each entry in this table consists of several lines.  The line with the
 index number at the left hand margin lists the current function.
 The lines above it list the functions that called this function,
 and the lines below it list the functions this one called.
 This line lists:
     index	A unique number given to each element of the table.
		Index numbers are sorted numerically.
		The index number is printed next to every function name so
		it is easier to look up where the function is in the table.

     % time	This is the percentage of the `total' time that was spent
		in this function and its children.  Note that due to
		different viewpoints, functions excluded by options, etc,
		these numbers will NOT add up to 100%.

     self	This is the total amount of time spent in this function.

     children	This is the total amount of time propagated into this
		function by its children.

     called	This is the number of times the function was called.
		If the function called itself recursively, the number
		only includes non-recursive calls, and is followed by
		a `+' and the number of recursive calls.

     name	The name of the current function.  The index number is
		printed after it.  If the function is a member of a
		cycle, the cycle number is printed between the
		function's name and the index number.


 For the function's parents, the fields have the following meanings:

     self	This is the amount of time that was propagated directly
		from the function into this parent.

     children	This is the amount of time that was propagated from
		the function's children into this parent.

     called	This is the number of times this parent called the
		function `/' the total number of times the function
		was called.  Recursive calls to the function are not
		included in the number after the `/'.

     name	This is the name of the parent.  The parent's index
		number is printed after it.  If the parent is a
		member of a cycle, the cycle number is printed between
		the name and the index number.

 If the parents of the function cannot be determined, the word
 `<spontaneous>' is printed in the `name' field, and all the other
 fields are blank.

 For the function's children, the fields have the following meanings:

     self	This is the amount of time that was propagated directly
		from the child into the function.

     children	This is the amount of time that was propagated from the
		child's children to the function.

     called	This is the number of times the function called
		this child `/' the total number of times the child
		was called.  Recursive calls by the child are not
		listed in the number after the `/'.

     name	This is the name of the child.  The child's index
		number is printed after it.  If the child is a
		member of a cycle, the cycle number is printed
		between the name and the index number.

 If there are any cycles (circles) in the call graph, there is an
 entry for the cycle-as-a-whole.  This entry shows who called the
 cycle (as parents) and the members of the cycle (as children.)
 The `+' recursive calls entry shows the number of function calls that
 were internal to the cycle, and the calls entry for each member shows,
 for that member, how many times it was called from other members of
 the cycle.

Podemos notar que houve uma melhora no número de chamadas de funções, vista a remoção da função SQR, e uma redução de 0.05s no tempo gasto pela função \texttt{timeStep}.

Apesar de parecer uma redução pequena, é importante lembrar que quanto maior a escala dos problemas, mais importante são essas otimizações.
